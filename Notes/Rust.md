# Rust learning notes

## The Book Wrap-up

### Basic Concept

+ `expect` and `unwrap` method are defined on `Result` 

+ tuple type: `let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);`

  array type: `let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`

  array type with explicitly declared size: `let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`

  array type with initialization to same value: `let a = [3; 5];`

+ The block that's used to create a new scope is an expression, so we can write like this:

  ```rust
  let x = {
      let y = 1;
      y + 1
  };
  ```

+ `if` is also an expression:

  ```rust
  let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
  ```

  note that `if` expression without `else` branch evaluates to `()`

+ `loop` is also an expression, whose value can be specified after `break`:

  ```rust
  let mut counter = 0;
  let result = loop {
      counter += 1;
      if counter == 10 {
          break counter * 2;
      }
  };
  ```

### Ownership

+ reference and slice don't take ownership

+ the type of variable that is initialized with string literals is `&str`, because it is essentially a reference to bytes stored in binary.

  string slices' type is `&str` while i32 slices' type is `&[i32]`.

+ string slice can be got from `[..]` on `String` or `str` while i32 slice can be got from `[..]` on `Vec<i32>` or `[i32]`.

### Struct

+ struct type variable can be initialized with a JSON-like format:

  ```rust
  let mut user1 = User {
      email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
      username: String::from("someusername123"),
      active: true,
      sign_in_count: 1,
  };
  ```

  if the filed name and variable name to fill that field are the same, we could write just once:

  ```rust
  User {
      email,
      username,
      active: true,
      sign_in_count: 1,
  }
  ```

  just like JavaScript, hah

+ struct update syntax:

  ```rust
  let user2 = User {
      email: String::from("another@example.com"),
      username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
      ..user1
  };
  ```

+ tuple struct is kinda like tuple, but they have different type even if types inside the tuple are all the same:

  ```rust
  struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
  struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
  
  let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
  let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
  ```

+ add `#[derive(Debug)]` annotation to a struct to make it able to pretty-print with `{:?}` and `{:#?}`.

+ define methods inside `impl` block:

  ```rust
  impl Rectangle {
      fn area(&self) -> u32 {
          self.width * self.height
      }
  }
  ```

  actually the first parameter here `&self` can also be `self`, `mut self` or `&mut self`, and it doesn't need to specify the type explicitly because compiler knows the type is struct type.

+ when we invoke methods, we write like `p1.distance(&p2);` directly instead of `(&p1).distance(&p2);` or `->` like cpp, because rust supports automatic referencing and dereferencing, and calling methods is a scenario where this behavior applies.

+ define associated functions (aka. static methods) by not writing `self` parameter.

### Enum

+ enum can have an internal value for each enumerator:

  ```rust
  fn main() {
      enum IpAddr {
          V4(String),
          V6(String),
      }
  
      let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
  
      let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
  }
  ```

+ the internal value type can even be anonymous struct:

  ```rust
  enum Message {
      Quit,
      Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
      Write(String),
      ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
  }
  ```

+ use `if let` to check whether the enumerator and its internal value are equal:

  ```rust
  if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
      println!("three");
  }
  ```

### Crate and Module

+ a package can have 0 or 1 library crate and any number of binary crates. My understanding is that library crate contains key logic of the package and binary crate is just like entrance (how to use the library).

+ A create is a tree of modules.

+ Each file under `src/bin` directory will be a separate binary crate

+ Package could contain a library crate with the same name as the package and `src/lib.rs` is the crate root. Correspondingly, `src/main.rs` is root of the binary crate whose name is the same as the package.

+ absolute path starts with the crate name or `crate` literal while relative path starts with `self`, `super` or  an identifier in the current module.

+ An item can access its ancestor and private sibling, but not private child of its sibling.

+ each field in the struct can be specified as public separately, while privacy of enumerators always corresponds to enum.

+ ```rust
  use std::io::Result as IoResult;
  pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;  // re-export
  use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};  // nested paths
  use std::io::{self, Write};
  ```

+ declaring mod in a file tells Rust to find its definition in another file whose filename is the same as the module name.

  `src/lib.rs`:

  ```rust
  mod front_of_house;
  ```

  `src/front_of_house.rs`:

  ```rust
  pub mod hosting;
  ```

  then there should be a file named `src/front_of_house/hosting.rs`.

### Collections

#### vector

+ create: `let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();` or `let v = vec![1, 2, 3];`
+ update: `let mut v = Vec::new(); v.push(3);`
+ read: `&v[1]` or `v.get(1)`, the latter returns an `Option`
+ iterate: `for i in &v` (if not reference here, `v` will get moved)

#### string

+ create: `::new()`, `::from()`
+ update: `push`, `push_str`, `operator+` or `format!`
+ read: use string slice `&s[0..2]`
+ iterate: `in s.chars()` or `in s.bytes()`

#### hashmap

`HashMap` is not in the prelude so we need to import it explicitly: `use std::collections::HashMap;`

+ create: `::new()`
+ update: `.insert()`
+ read: `.get()`
+ iterate: `for (k, v) in &map`

### Error handling

+ `panic!`

+ `operator?` to unwrap Ok value or return Err value:

  ```rust
  fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
      let mut f = File::open("hello.txt")?;
      let mut s = String::new();
      f.read_to_string(&mut s)?;
      Ok(s)
  }
  ```

### Generics, Traits and Lifetimes

#### Generics

+ generic struct:

  ```rust
  struct Point<T> {
      x: T,
      y: T,
  }
  
  impl<T> Point<T> {
      fn x(&self) -> &T {
          &self.x
      }
  }
  ```

+ generic enum:

  ```rust
  enum Result<T, E> {
      Ok(T),
      Err(E),
  }
  ```

+ generic function:

  ```rust
  fn largest<T: PartialOrd + Copy>(list: &[T]) -> T;
  ```

#### Traits

+ trait is just like *interface* or *pure virtual class* (trait can also provide default implementations):

  ```rust
  pub trait Summary {
      fn summarize(&self) -> String;
  }
  ```

  implement a trait on a type:

  ```rust
  impl Summary for Tweet {
      fn summarize(&self) -> String {
          format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
      }
  }
  ```

+ trait bound, i.e. the type that implements the trait:

  ```rust
  pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
      println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
  }
  
  pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
      println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
  }
  
  pub fn notify<T>(item: &T) 
      where T: Summary
  {...}
  
  fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
      Tweet {
          username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
          content: String::from(
              "of course, as you probably already know, people",
          ),
          reply: false,
          retweet: false,
      }
  }
  ```

+ trait bounds can be used to accomplish functionality similar to *template specialization* in cpp:

  ```rust
  struct Pair<T> {
      x: T,
      y: T,
  }
  
  impl<T> Pair<T> {
      fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
          Self { x, y }
      }
  }
  
  impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
      fn cmp_display(&self) {
          if self.x >= self.y {
              println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
          } else {
              println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

#### Lifetimes

+ Lifetime annotations donâ€™t change how long any of the references live, they just help borrow checker finish the check.

+ like generic type, lifetime specifier also needs to declare before use:

  ```rust
  fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str;
  ```

+ lifetime annotation in struct:

  ```rust
  struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
      part: &'a str,
  }
  
  impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
      fn level(&self) -> i32 {
          3
      }
  }
  ```

+ [Lifetime elision rules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#lifetime-elision)

+ `'static` lifetime

### Tests

+ put unit tests alongside tested code.

  ```rust
  #[cfg(test)]
  mod tests {
      #[test]
      fn it_works() {
          assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
      }
  }
  ```

+ put integration tests under `tests/` directory separately.

  ```rust
  use adder;
  
  #[test]
  fn it_adds_two() {
      assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
  }
  ```

### Closures and Iterators

+ closures compared to functions:

  ```rust
  fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
  let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
  let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
  let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;
  ```

+ use `move` keyword before parameter list to force the closure to take ownership of variables it uses.

+ closures can implement the `Fn`, `FnMut` and `FnOnce` traits.

  ```rust
  struct Cacher<T>
  where
      T: Fn(u32) -> u32,
  {
      calculation: T,
      value: Option<u32>,
  }
  ```

+ all iterators implement the `Iterator` trait:

  ```rust
  pub trait Iterator {
      type Item;
  
      fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
  
      // methods with default implementations elided
  }
  ```

## Something worth noting

+ when reading Chapter 12, the book, I tried that tiny project in VS Code. There is a red squiggle under `use minigrep::Config;` when first typing that, a workaround is to reload vscode.
+ type casting in Rust: `x as i32`
+ using a value to construct a field in the struct will move that value

## Q & A

+ Do the library crate (`src/lib.rs`) and binary crate (`src/main.rs`) have the same crate name?
+ What is blanket implementation?
