## Some questions that may be asked

+ **Tell me a little about yourself**

  I'm Tao Bocheng. I'm now a junior majoring in software engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

  During the period of school, I write code in cpp most of the time. I really like it.

  In the last semester, I've been invloved in a project about security inspection and monitoring.

  Also, I've made a tiny tool for conversion from pseudo-code to flowchat in character format.

  And I'm very interested in the knowledge about computer system and familier with Linux.

  In addition, I'd like to share some of my notes, discoveries and thoughts on my personal blog and GitHub around my learning.

+ **Why do you want to work here?**

+ **Tell me about the project**

  It's a secutiry system for inspection and monitoring, which aims at the third-party application that may be risky. 

  The whole system divides into two parts. The first one is to analyze statically. We read the user-defined configuration file into our system, then use ptrace to analyze the third-party application statically and finally generate a report about the application's behaviour.

  The second part is to monitor in real-time. We use seccomp, which is a security tool provided by linux, to set up a sandbox environment in which we run the target application. And once the application tries some risky operations we will shut it down.
