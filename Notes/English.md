## Some questions that may be asked

### HR interview

+ **Tell me a little about yourself**

  OK, As you can see on my resume,

  I'm Tao Bocheng. I'm now a junior majoring in software engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

  // It’s my great honor to be given this great opportunity to talk with you here.

  During the period of school, I write code in cpp most of the time. I really like it.

  In the last semester, I've been fortunately invloved in a project about security inspection and monitoring, which is a cooperative project between Optiver and SJTU.

  Also, I've made a tiny tool for conversion from pseudo-code to flowchat in character format.

  And I'm very interested in the knowledge about computer system and I'm familier with Linux.

  In addition, I'd like to share some of my notes, discoveries and thoughts on my personal blog and GitHub around my learning.

+ **Tell me about the project**

  It's a secutiry system for inspection and monitoring, which aims at the third-party application that may be risky. 

  The whole system divides into two parts. The first one is to analyze statically. We read the user-defined configuration file into our system, then use ptrace to analyze the third-party application statically and finally generate a report about the application's behaviour.

  The second part is to monitor in real-time. We use seccomp, which is a security tool provided by linux, to set up a sandbox environment in which we run the target application. And once the application tries some risky operations that we forbid we will shut it down. Also we evaluate the temporal overhead of our system.

+ **What's your strengthens?**

  As you can see in my resume, I'm pretty interested in cpp and good at it.

  And also I have essential knowledge about computer system due to our curriculum.

  And through those projects I have taken part in, I also have some experience about how to work together as a team effectively.

  What's more, I am relatively flexible and able to handle change in my job responsibility because for new things or new technique, I am always curious and willing to learn and have a try.

+ **What's your weaknesses?**

  Although I can keep flexible when I'm faced with new things or new technique, I might get nervous when talking to strangers, especially in English but this may not last too long if I try to get familiar with them.

  Also sometimes I may be kind of obstinate and stubborn, especially when I think my point of view is right but also I am trying to correct it as I have more and more communication with others.

+ **Why do you want to work here?**

  Optiver is a prop'rietary trading firm and market maker for various exchange-listed financial instruments.

  I heared about Optiver from seniors in our lab at the very beginning and I also got a chance fortunately to take part in the cooperative project of Optiver and SJTU. When I firstly got in touch with the project, I was really attracted by the application background and the pure fun of somewhat practical software.

  And also, after several times of reporting our current work at Optiver, the perfect working environment there really leaves me a deep impression.

  And as I learned more and more about what a developer's work is in Optiver, I found it really a good match between that and my acquired knowledge, technology stack and interests. So I hope and believe I can take the summer internship and become part of Optiver.

+ **an impressive experience or difficulty**

  S: In my second semester of sophomore, we had a course presentation of Database. 

  T: We were a team of four members but only one could take the presentation. At that time one of them, called Yuan and I both wanted to take that chance and we both thought that the other one couldn't be qualified. Because, you know, our score was determined by the performance of the one speaking.

  A: So we came up an idea. We both spoke to another member and let him make the decision which one can take the chance to give the presentation. And finally I won and I did make a good job.

  R: So from that experience, I understood deeply that the chances you strive for and the ones others give you or you get easily are really very different. The former is much more precious. So since then, for the chance I wanna take, I may act like, kind of, more ambitious and more active.

+ **an impressive course**

  Maybe Compiler, a course taken in the first semester of junior. 

  Because in my perspective, Compiler is the hardest course in all of our curriculum, even more difficult than operating system and CSAPP. 

  It's challenging but rewarding. On the one hand, the course content is really too much and difficult to understand; but on the other hand, when I finished the course and completed the course project, I felt totally accomplished and indeed, Compiler taught me a lot of, you know, low-level or fundamental knowledge about computer system that really benefits me.

  There is one thing which really impressed me is that the task of lab five of Compiler is to complete all the components except register allocation, which is the most challenging one. But the fact is that a compiler cannot work without register allocation so the actual solution is to implement a naive version of register allocation but at that time I thought instead of this, I'd rather implement the real one directly, which means I would work on lab five and six together. However the task is a little bit more difficult than I thought so I stayed up really late to complete them just before deadline, luckily.

  And that decision helped me save the valuable time before final exam because I had completed lab six with lab five.

+ **Do you have any question?**

  + When will I take the next round of interview if I pass this one? next week? or just after a few days?
  + What is the top quality the candidate needs to have / in order to become a best performer in the following interviews and as a developer in Optiver?
  + As far as I know, Optiver doesn't provide dinner, so what if someone works overtime. Does he need to have dinner outside?
  + Could you give me any evaluation or suggestions about my performance in today's interview?
  + Could you talk a little about how you feel about Optiver from a perspective of a, you know, veteran?
