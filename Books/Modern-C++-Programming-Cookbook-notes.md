### 1.1  Using auto whenever possible

+ In C++11, we can use `auto` to define local variables and specify return type of functions with a trailing return type;

  In C++14, we can also use `auto` for return type of functions without a trailing return type and argument  types of lambda.

+ Actually using `auto` is so recommended that there appears a term called *AAA*, which stands for *almost always auto*. Indeed `auto` has many edges but I still don't completely agree that term.

+ So how to explain the *always*, where could we use `auto`? I want to talk about the local variable scenario:

  + when defining a variable whose type doesn't need specifying explicitly, we could use `auto`:

    ```c++
    auto s = "text";      // char const * 
    auto v = { 1, 2, 3 }; // std::initializer_list<int> 
    ```

  + when defining a variable whose type needs specifying explicitly, we could also use `auto`:

    ```c++
    auto s = std::string {"text"};         // std::string
    auto v = std::vector<int> { 1, 2, 3 }; // std::vector<int>
    ```

+ And now let's compare the pros and cons about `auto`. First there are many advantages, including making it impossible to leave variables uninitialized, avoiding implicit conversion and less typing. However, there also some shortcomings, such as being hard to find the actual type without help of IDE and prone to some problems about type deduction.

  For example, in the case of perfect forwarding, we need to use `decltype(auto)` as return type to return value for value and reference for reference.
